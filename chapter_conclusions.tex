\chapter{Conclusions}

Improved studies of the spectroscopy of neutralized Ba\textsuperscript{+} deposits in SXe have been presented.  Of particular interest was temperature and annealing effects, as well as bleaching effects of the 577-, 591-, and 619-nm fluorescence peaks.  Fluorescence was maximal in deposits made around 50~K and observed at 11~K.  The 577- and 591-nm peaks experience similarly rapid bleaching.  A model applied to bleaching data of the 591-nm peak demonstrated agreement with optical pumping rates of Ba in vacuum near the beginning of the bleaching process, with subsequent deviation.  The 619-nm peak experiences much lower bleaching rates.

Understanding of these effects aided in the design of imaging experiments.  Imaging of Ba atoms in SXe in a focused laser region was demonstrated down to the $\leq 10^{3}$-atom level using the 577- and 591-nm peaks, and down to the single-atom level using the low-bleaching 619-nm peak.

\section{Future Steps}

The next major demonstration will be imaging separate Ba atoms in SXe using a scanned focused laser.  A few techniques will be explored in overcoming the challenge of the variable surface background emission.  For example, studies of fluorescence lifetimes of the 619-nm signal vs. the background using a pulsed laser and a photo-multiplier tube for fast detection could suggest a photon-sorting technique in eliminating background.
