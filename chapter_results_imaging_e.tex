Results from Ba spectroscopy presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:spectroscopy} were used to determine the best conditions for imaging small numbers of Ba atoms in SXe.  Optimum excitation wavelengths were determined by studying the excitation spectra of the signal as well as the background.  Bleaching studies determined optimum laser intensity to be used.  Deposits made at $50 \pm 5$~K produced more Ba fluorescence signal than those made at 11~K.  Based on these considerations, an image of Ba atoms emitting at 577 and 591~nm is presented in Sec. \ref{sec:imaging590and577} at the level of $\leq 2700$ average atoms exposed. Images of Ba atoms emitting at 619~nm down to the single-atom level are then presented in Sec. \ref{sec:imaging619}.  Initial scanned images of Ba\textsuperscript{+} deposits are presented in Sec. \ref{sec:scanning}.

First attempts at imaging small numbers of Ba atoms in a focused laser region were done with the 577- and 591-nm Ba fluorescence peaks together using a 586-nm band-pass filter, which passes 573 - 599~nm FWHM.  This filter has a 2" diameter, resulting in a nominal collection efficiency of $8.4 \times 10^{-3}$, 4$\times$ the efficiency given in Table \ref{table:colleff}.  An image of $\leq 2700$ atoms instantaneously in the laser region is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:image590s} for a 100-s exposure with 0.02~$\mu$W of 566-nm excitation.  The laser was focused by the bi-convex lens, resulting in a beam radius of 5~$\mu$m, as discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:laser}.  With this spot size, the factor between total and average atoms exposed is 3, as discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:vibes}, resulting in $\leq 8300$ total atoms exposed.  At this low intensity, no bleaching was observed in the four frames observed (frame 1 is shown).  Groups of 9 ($3 \times 3$) CCD pixels have been binned in software to produce the peak shown.  Detection of single Ba atoms in these sites may require several re-pump lasers, as discussed in \ref{sec:bleaching}.  As a result of low total exposure, neither the sapphire nor the surface backgrounds are present in these images.

%Bleaching data was used to optimize laser intensity and exposure time to achieve maximal signal in frame 1, and to avoid hole bleaching.  The fast bleaching of these peaks is the limiting factor on sensitivity.

\section{Imaging 619-nm Fluorescence}
\label{sec:imaging619}

Raw images of Ba\textsuperscript{+} deposits and their preceding and succeeding Xe-only deposits are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:xebaxe} for deposits of (a) $\leq 49$ ($\leq 230$), (b) $\leq 4$ ($\leq 20$), and (c) $\leq 1$ ($\leq 5$) average (total) number of Ba atoms exposed.  Exposures are 60~s with around 0.24~mW of 570~nm excitation focused to w$_{\text{x}} \times$ w$_{\text{y}} =$ 2.06~$\mu$m $\times$ 2.66~$\mu$m with the aspherical laser focusing lens and astigmatism compensator.  Thus the factor between total and average atoms exposed is 4.7.  Signal is distinguishable from background by eye, even with an average number of exposed atoms at the 1-atom level.

%An imaging experiment consisted of many different pulsed Ba\textsuperscript{+} deposits, each of which was evaporated after observation.  This procedure is described in \ref{sec:deposition}-\ref{sec:collection}.

\label{fig:train}
\end{figure}

To determine signal level, counts were summed from of a 3-pixel$\times$3-pixel (15$\mu$m$\times$15$\mu$m) region centered on the laser spot in the image.  Background was determined by averaging the 3-pixel$\times$3-pixel sum of the Xe-only runs before and after each Ba\textsuperscript{+} run.  Signal and background were scaled to laser power, and then background was subtracted.

The integrated 619-nm fluorescence signal is plotted vs. average number of ions (upper limit on atoms) exposed in Fig. \ref{fig:lin} for many deposits in two experiments with two different laser focusing lenses:  (a) asphere with astigmatism compensation, and (b) bi-convex.  Exposures were (a) 60~s with 0.24~mW laser power, and (b) 3~s with 2~mW laser power, respectively.  The two experiments demonstrate linear relationships between signal and number of ions exposed over more than two orders of magnitude.  This is important evidence that the 619-nm peak arises from Ba and not, e.g., Ba$_{2}$, which would exhibit a quadratic relationship with ions deposited.  Zero-ion deposits are produced by retracting the Faraday cup for 1~s without pulsing the ion beam.  The slope of the linear fit in (a), which does not include a constant value, gives about $1500 \pm 160$~counts/mW per atom with 60-s exposures.  %Deposits at the single-ion level average to $5000 \pm 2400$~counts/mW.

Images of 619-nm Ba fluorescence are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:train} for a few deposits near the linear trend line.  In each case the image of a the preceding Xe-only deposit is subtracted so that only the Ba fluorescence is seen.  Clear, sharp peaks are observed from an average number of atoms all the way down to the single-atom level.  This result is significant advance beyond the sensitivity reported in \cite{Mong2015}, and a major step toward the ultimate success of Ba tagging.  It is generating excitement and interest in the nEXO collaboration.

Exposures are 0.5~s with 0.6~mW of 572~nm excitation focused with asphere and astigmatism compensator.}
\label{fig:xebaxeLarger}
\end{figure}

Another very significant observation is the lack of Ba fluorescence in Xe-only deposits made after evaporating the matrix, even for large Ba\textsuperscript{+} deposits.  This is demonstrated in Fig. \ref{fig:xebaxe}, where no Ba fluorescence is present in the Xe-only runs following each of the deposits.  This is shown further for a $\leq 76,000$ Ba atom deposit in Fig. \ref{fig:xebaxeLarger}.  The lack of a history effect after evaporation of each sample is important for the implementation of this method of Ba tagging on a probe in nEXO.  Once a Ba daughter has been identified in SXe on a cold probe, the sample can be removed without the Ba atom or ion giving false positives on subsequent events.

\section{Scanned Images}
\label{sec:scanning}

The ultimate demonstration of single-atom imaging will be to scan the focused laser over samples with more widely separated Ba atoms, observing a peak when the laser moves over individual atoms.  The resolution in a scanned image is determined by the laser spot size, even when the imaging optics have a lower resolution.  Preliminary scans were performed by scanning the focusing lens in a raster pattern, using the setup described in Sec. \ref{sec:laserscanning}.  Summed counts/mW from a $3 \times 3$ pixel area around the focused laser are plotted vs. raster position for several deposits in Fig. \ref{fig:scans}.  These scans are grids of 20 points in X at about 3.75~$\mu$m/step, by 5 points in Y at about 4.78~$\mu$m/step.  An overall higher signal is observed with 48.4 average Ba\textsuperscript{+}/step (c), however single-atom peaks are not distinguished in the sparse deposit of 0.18 average Ba\textsuperscript{+}/step (b).  The aspherical laser focusing lens and astigmatism compensator are used for w$_{\text{x}} \times$ w$_{\text{y}} =$ 2.06~$\mu$m $\times$ 2.66~$\mu$m 1/e$^{2}$ laser region, though cryostat vibrations increase the exposed region as described in Sec. \ref{sec:vibes}.  This had the effect of exposing neighboring step regions to the laser.  Pre-bleaching of the surface background was done with a raster of the dye laser at 580.5~nm, in a $22 \times 7$ grid centered on the $20 \times 5$ grid used during the following experiment, with 10~s at each location.

\label{fig:scanVarXe}
\end{figure}

Signal and background levels from the scanned images in Fig. \ref{fig:scans} are consistent with previous experiments, with approximately 440~counts/mW {\color{red}$pm$ ???} per Ba atom, and about 4500~counts/mW background, with 10-s exposures.  However, the scanned images of Xe-only deposits (Fig. \ref{fig:scans}(a)) produce a measure of step-to-step variation in the surface background which competes with the single-atom signal level for about {\color{red}? -- get from the $\sigma$ value}\% of the fluctuations.  The difference in counts between successive grid steps is shown as a distribution in Fig.\ref{fig:scanVarXe}(a) for all Xe-only deposits in this set of scanned images.  The single-atom signal level of {\color{red}$833 \pm ???$}~counts/mW (for 10-s exposure) is marked with a gray dotted line, which intersects the background distribution at the ? level.  The step-to-step variation in the subtraction of two Xe-only scanned images is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scanVarXe}.  This distribution is somewhat broader than that of the raw background images, with the single-atom level intersecting at the ? level.  It is difficult to distinguish single Ba atoms from background fluctuations under these conditions.

The single-atom signal level of $250 \pm 27$~counts/mW assumes 100\% conversion of deposited Ba\textsuperscript{+} ions.  Thus, it is possible that single Ba atoms produce more signal than this, and that, e.g., the peak around (?,?) in Fig. \ref{fig:scans}(?) is due to a single atom.  However, background levels must be reduced further to be sure.  The next steps in scanned imaging of Ba atoms, discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:future}, will involve reducing the surface background.
