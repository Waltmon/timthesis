\chapter{Results}

Studies of several emission peaks of neutral Ba in SXe are discussed in \ref{sec:fluorescence}.  Bleaching of these peaks is discussed in detail in \ref{sec:bleaching}.  Imaging of Ba fluorescence in a focused laser region is discussed in \ref{imaging}, with the ultimate achievement of imaging at the single atom level using the 619-nm fluorescence peak.  Candidate fluorescence peaks of Ba\textsuperscript{+} in SXe are reported in \ref{sec:BaPlus}.

\section{Fluorescence of Ba in SXe}
\label{sec:fluorescence}

Deposits of Ba in SXe absorb primarily between 540~nm and 570~nm \cite{Mong2015,Brian,Shon}.  An absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BaAbs}, along with an example emission spectrum.

The multiple peaks observed from deposits of Ba in SXe are attributed to Ba atoms occupying different Xe matrix sites, the phenomena of which are described in Chapter 3 {\color{red}(\emph{ref chap theory doesn't work})}.  Fig. [ref fig spectra for 10K, 50K, annealed 10K] shows spectra of Ba deposits under different conditions.  A deposit made at 11~K shows a different ... um how is this described in the paper?
