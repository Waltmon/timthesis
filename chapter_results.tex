\chapter{Results}

First I describe the emission spectra for neutral Ba in SXe, which are first reported in the theses of B. Mong [ref] and S. Cook [ref].  Improved studies of several emission peaks are reported.  The bleaching of several of these peaks is carefully observed [{\color{do a correction on p-meter sensitive area and on p-meter quantum efficiency}}], and a model of atomic transition rates is fit to this data.  Improved excitation spectra are achieved for all observed Ba emission peaks.  Images of $\leq$ 10\textsuperscript{3\textbf{?}} Ba atoms are achieved using the bleaching peaks.  Ultimately, images of Ba atoms at the few-atom level are achieved using the 619-nm fluorescence peak.  Improved studies of candidate fluorescence peaks of Ba\textsuperscript{+} in SXe are also reported.
