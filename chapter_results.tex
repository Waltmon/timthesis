\emph{\color{gray}Was there something more you wanted to put in experimental?}

Studies of several emission peaks of neutral Ba in SXe are discussed in \ref{sec:fluorescence}.  Temperature and annealing dependence are discussed in \ref{subsec:tempanneal}.  Bleaching of these peaks is discussed in detail in \ref{subsec:bleaching}.  Imaging of Ba fluorescence in a focused laser region is discussed in \ref{imaging}, with the ultimate achievement of imaging at the single atom level using the 619-nm fluorescence peak.  Candidate fluorescence peaks of Ba\textsuperscript{+} in SXe are reported in \ref{sec:BaPlus}.

\section{Fluorescence of Ba in SXe}
\label{sec:fluorescence}

Deposits of Ba in SXe absorb primarily between 540~nm and 570~nm.  An absorption spectrum, obtained by observing absorption of white light by a large Ba deposit at 11~K, is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BaAbs}, along with an example emission spectrum.  Significant broadening, as well as a 4-nm redshift  of the central peak, occur relative to the vacuum $6s^{2}$ $^{1}$S$_{0} \rightarrow 6s6p$ $^{1}$P$_{1}$ absorption value of 553.5~nm.  The observation of the same absorption and emission spectra with deposits made with the Ba\textsuperscript{+} ion beam as with the neutral Ba getter source demonstrate some neutralization of the ions.  The fraction of ions neutralized is not determined.  \cite{Mong2015,Shon,Brian}

The several red-shifted emission peaks observed are attributed to Ba atoms occupying different matrix sites in the SXe.  Deposition at temperatures higher than 11~K and exploration of more excitation wavelengths have led to discovery of a few emission peaks beyond the 591- and 577-nm peaks reported in \cite{Shon} and \cite{Brian}.  Emission spectra for selected excitation wavelengths are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:excitspecGrn}(a), for a deposit made at 44~K and observed at 11~K.  These selections are part of a full excitation spectrum, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:excitspecGrn}(b).

\emph{\color{gray}Care about 10~K excitation spectrum?}

Magnitudes have been scaled for visibility on the same plot (relative magnitudes are arbitrary as they are affected by relative site populations and fluorescence efficiencies).  The discontinuity around 566~nm for the 619- and 670-nm peaks is the boundary between usage of different laser dyes.  R6G dye is used for higher wavelengths and R110 for lower wavelengths and for all other curves.  Curves for the R6G segments (619- and 670-nm peaks) require special scaling to line up with their respective R110 segments, and this scaling was different between the 619- and 670-nm peaks, likely due to different relative populations of those sites on the different deposits.}

\subsection{Annealing/Temperature Dependence}
\label{subsec:tempanneal}

\emph{\color{gray}When does it need to be mentioned that certain data was also used in the paper(s)?}

Matrix site occupancies for Ba atoms can depend on annealing history, and similarly on the temperature at which a deposit is made.  Spectra under different conditions are shown in Fig. [fig spectra temp/anneal].  \emph{\color{gray}Describe it -- should you do a new one with other peaks?  There is more 577, but is 591 the same? It looks so in the paper plot, but were they scaled? \textbf{... and point out here that the signal is higher especially for the 619, which is important to us.}}  

Fluorescence signal through several annealing cycles for a deposit made at 11~K is shown for \emph{\color{gray}(all observed peaks?)} in Fig. [fig annealing cycles].  \emph{\color{gray}Describe relevant things -- gain in some, loss?  Show annealing of a 50~K dep? (Did we ever do that?) -- and say how there is some loss when going to higher temp, possibly refering to a statement in a paper about diffusion becoming possible.}

Direct temperature dependence of fluorescence is also observed in annealing cycles.  For all Ba peaks, fluorescence all but disappears by ? K.  This could be due to a different matrix environment at higher temperature, or possibly a loss of fluorescence efficiency due to increased non-radiative decays from the excited state.  This suggests that a probe in nEXO will need to be moved to an evacuated chamber in order to cool to 11~K or below for observation.

\subsection{Bleaching}
\label{subsec:bleaching}

({\color{red}do a correction on p-meter sensitive area and on p-meter quantum efficiency, and also a spherical aberation correction for power, though that may not matter for the defocused studies.})

590 etc, model fit (see results intro paragraph)

\subsection{Further Checks on 619-nm Peak}

\emph{\color{gray}getter and Ar$^{+}$ for 619 \textbf{\color{gray}This section was claimed in Ba getter section of Chapter 3 to talk about getter use in identifying 619.}}

Also have stuff on ruling out extra-BP stuff, and something else I think.

Leak rate dependence -- ``Leak rates resulting in [x nm/s $\rightarrow$ 1:xxx Ba:Xe] optimize fluorescence, which is consistent with rates where Ba-Ba interactions are minimized [ref?] \emph{\color{gray}(are there other explanation?  check the gas oxidation thing.)}.  Rates higher than this result in rapid frosting ..." \emph{\textbf{\color{gray}May also just put this at the end of the  Fluorescence section.}}
