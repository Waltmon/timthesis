? larger ("10^4") deposit for 5902 image figure?

NOT SURE THERE'S TIME TO SOLVE:
1)  eff. loss of fluor. at SXe interface, and of laser on window interface





* find anti-cor plot -- of calib source with resolution of each?  and finish that paragraph
w ask whoever made sensitivity plot whether it is 1(2) sigma (look for Josh email)
* alpha ion reference? (at end of Ch.1)
* just re-run xebaxe_largerst... for the orange text
* same for thesis_xebaxe(), since it seemed squished, which will involve re-putting in the (a),..., and "scrunching" it (for the caption)
w look for 3P1 --> 1S0 rate (w/ ref)
* (sorta -- conservatively saying we got "Research" and not "research plus", whch would be 99.999) check Xe bottle purity and put in section Sample Deposition (Ch.3)
* find P. Toschek + H. Dehmelt (sp?) 1970s Ba+ paper (and Dave Wineland?)
* do side view thing on Ba getter picture
