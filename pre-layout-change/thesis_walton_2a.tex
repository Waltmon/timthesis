\documentclass[PhD, copyrightpage]{csuthesis} %draft means that it won't actually render any pictures (graphs) it will just include space for them.
% As soon as you get this to compile, your next step
% should be to remove the draft option, so that your
% figures will show up.  Right now it's there so that
% the document will compile as is, with sample figures.

% If the grad school gives you grief for the smallcaps
% (all caps but capital capitals slightly larger) then
% you can use the "nosmallcaps" option to eliminate
% all smallcaps from the preliminary pages.

% The "copyrightpage" option tells the document class
% to generate a copyright page.  If you don't want a
% copyright page, erase that option.

% Now, change the following fields to match your thesis:
\title{Barium Tagging in Solid Xenon for the nEXO Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Experiment}
\author{Timothy Walton}
\departmentname{Department of Physics}
\gradterm{Fall} %The semester that you are going to turn this in.
% The year will automatically be set to the current year.  If you
% want to modify the year manually, use this command:
%\gradyear{2014}
% But otherwise, ignore that command.
\advisor{William M. Fairbank, Jr.}
%\coadvisor{Test Test} %optional
\committee{Robert Wilson \and someone \and Alan Van Orden} %separate committee names with \and
%committee names should not have any honorifics (i.e. NO Dr., PhD, professor, etc.)  Just names.

% you do not need these newcommand lines.
% They are my personal shorthand for derivatives.
\newcommand{\deriv}[2]{\frac{\mathrm{d}#1}{\mathrm{d}#2}}
\newcommand{\dby}[1]{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}#1}}
\newcommand{\pd}[2]{\frac{\partial#1}{\partial#2}}
\newcommand{\pby}[1]{\frac{\partial}{\partial#1}}

\usepackage{lipsum}%this package provides nonsense text for testing document layouts.  Not needed for real thesis.

% a couple useful options that you may wish to uncomment:
% \setcounter{tocdepth}{3} %more depth in table of contents
% \numberwithin{equation}{chapter} %display eqn # as 1.3, not 3
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{References} %change the name of your bibliography
% numberwithin commands for table, figure, and section are 
% already included in the .cls file.  You can search for 
% them and remove them if you want to.

\begin{document}
\frontmatter
%turns the page numbering to roman, and does some other stuff.

\input{abstract}
%\begin{abstract}
%abztrakt
%\end{abstract}
% note that for amsbook (which is basically the class we are copying), the abstract must be declared before the title.  It prints as part of maketitle.
% personally, I put my abstract definition in a separate file, abs_for_diss.tex, and used \input{abs_for_diss} here.
% The grad school requires an abstract.

\input{acknowledgements}
%this is optional.  It must be declared before maketitle, a lot like abstract.  Consider having this in a separate file, like ack.tex, and then using \input{ack}

\maketitle
% maketitle is a huge command in a small package.  It will render the title page, copyright page, acknowledgements, abstract, and probably a bunch of other stuff that I'm forgetting about.  If you choose not to define copyright, acknowledgements, etc, it automatically doesn't render them.

% other optional frontmatter could go somewhere in here.  dedication, biography, etc.  Grad school lists approved frontmatter pages somewhere.
% most frontmatter than I consider silly is not yet automated.  Also most frontmatter doesn't have any explicit style requirements, so I feel justified in ignoring it.

\tableofcontents %don't move this around too much
%\listoftables %optional, but this is the spot it should go
%\listoffigures %optional, but this is the right location for it

\mainmatter %switches page numbering to normal, resets page counter, etc.
% This is the start of the main writing, but there are a couple more
% notes that I think might be helpful, tossed in here and there with
% the format testing stuff.

\input{chapter_intro}
\input{chapter_theory}
\input{chapter_EXO}
\input{chapter_apparatus}
\input{chapter_results}
\input{chapter_conclusions}

%\backmatter %...this doesn't seem to do anything

\appendix %this switches to apppendix mode.  Now any new chapters will be appendices instead of chapters.

\chapter{Supplementary Material} %this will be displayed as an appendix, not a chapter.  Appendices are at the same level in the hierarchy as chapters.

make these also into separate files plz

\section{Some Sample Material}

Appendix is a strange name.  Did the name for the written material come before the name of the organ? Here~\cite{infodim} is a citation in an appendix.

\chapter{Another Supplement}

% still missing some, like backmatter (what is that?), and bibliography:

% <same preamble as we have here>
% \begin{document}
% \frontmatter
% \input{abstract}
% \input{acknowledgements}
% \maketitle
% \mainmatter
% \input{ch1intro}
% \input{anotherchapter}
