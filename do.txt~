- intro:
  - read about CP-violation aspect of Majorana phases to make your statement -- are they Dirac and Majorana CP-violating phases, respectively?
  - read KATRIN paper for their mass definition (being different from what you thought was just an expectation value)
  - find posting of sensitivity plot for if it's 1- and 2-sigma regions, and make this yourself

- theory:
  - Bill:  refs for Ba rates
  - Bill:  soln to 6-level -- small w12?
  - fiz up Franck-Condon pic

- results:
  w two gray refs for Be:Xe and diffusion at x K
  w talk to Bill about sine fit to x (or rotated?) vibes (1.56 Adam got by hand on 50-ms ... you too?)
  - make less important plots side-by-side
  - better-looking train plot -- somehow w/ a bunch more images? w/ atoms ranges noted?
  - scanned images sec.
  * plots for blue excit.
  w bleaching green excitspec
  * fixed 619 bleach plot
  - talk to Bill about discrepancies between this and BaSpec -- leak rate and 11 K vs. 10 K


- do yourself the surface bg excitspec
- do yourself 2D dust spot stuff, cuz chris had less noisy results on his first try, andthe new one sucks
- thicker borders on small plots? test with excit spec to match the big one in that same figure.
- ba tagging in intro should have reference to Thomas gas tagging (does it?)
- if you're not refering to ba spec paper in intro, need to move the reference (did you?)




Results:  spec
1)  peaks / excitspec -- more detail on fits:  don't call asym a Gaus, and show that it doesn't alway work great but it still follows peaks
2)  temp dependence --> defines deposit/excitation conditions
3)  bleaching
4)  BGs
5)  candidate Ba+

Results: imaging
intro: the stuff learned above informs conditions for imaging
1)  imaging 590
2)  imaging 619
3)  scanning
