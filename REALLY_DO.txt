- THETA 23 HAS WRONG DECIMAL PLACE IN TABLE
- measure difference between gain / ADC modes (at some point)
- 10^4 image
- fix cross sections by fitting/extending
- want a statement of "becomes bleached after x excitations"?  It reaches 1/e of (initial - "SS") in maybe 40,000 excit. in (b) and (c) of green/purple plots, but (a) is sort of different
- check all data which you produced quickly in the middle of the night -- OF SPECIAL CONCERN is the light blue bleach model curve, since it's sort of discrepant, and you did that pretty quick
- fix w12 in QE plot
- Sr lines in Blue excit.
- shallower S in Franck Condon (see comments)
- short-time comment by Bill in 5-level model leading to exp decay at beginning, and demonstration of this in ch.5?
- need franck condon ref (see bill comments)
- may want the rate-change paragraph uncommented at end of matrix iso., but need to se Bill comments
- check M. Danilov ref [5] in corrections Ch. 1 v.3 corrections.pnf
- smaller text in dub beta dec spectrum figure
- remove repeat deposits in bleaching data (including model), change comment on consistency then
- make color 2D gaus fits on astig fit fig.
- * Question of Bill on pg. 16 of Ch 3 v3 corrections.pdf
- coll eff stuff in Ch 3 v3 corrections.pdf
- "need to think about" comment on fitting in Bill comments (sec. 14.1.2)
- also comment on Cr3+ stuff (sideways)
- also on that page need to specify Raman wavelength stuff
- plot time instead of Run Numb. in surf bleach plot
- get ref for wuantum dots in cocnnlusions
- "fix this later" in Theory
- possible comment on large % of atoms in 619, at end of section right before Bleaching of the 619-nm Peak section (see Bill comments)
- change cross sections to cm^2
- sentence beginning w/ superscript 136 in Intro

- check citation orders anf giures too

- 1st parag of nu oscill. subsection: make it 2 sentences with perios before "that is, ..."
- change franck condon image ref to ...2.png
- semi-log on re-pump plots?  prolly

* check anti-corr plot:  is it actually like that in the real 2-nu?  otherwise idk what you should do. [it's in orig. 0nu]
* (sorta)check Xe bottle purity
