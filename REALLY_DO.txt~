good:  13
NEED:
- 2:  energy level figs, 2.2 is refered to too far back -- may need to put table on 1st page and have Ba and Ba+ on same page

on figure placement, remember you can add white space at the top of an image, which may help a little on things where there are two separate figures on one page, e.g. figures 4.7 and 4.8




* The number of Ar+ in laser region in fig 5.3b -- I bet a correction should have been made, if you give a crap.
* re-read the final paragraph one more time, and also the new (last) paragraph in Calibration of Ion Deposit section
* find and re-read the explanation of the 0.8
* Yes, like nothing is said about the BG vs temp... I don think you even mention te sapphire. Talks about it, an change surface to surface +BG, in legend too
w Could even have a side figure showing the integrated regions with arrows from the legend, with explanation in text
* Caption for fig 5.10 add "normalized" at beginning like the previous figure
* things on group meeting paper about the BG vs. Temp. plot:  LEFT OFF:  in bg_temp_20150513(), which is at end of image_20150513(), make ofstream w/ option for outputting data for reading from thesis script, then change thesis script to read that one, then put in text that they're 3x3 integrals, etc...   AND MAKE SURE THE INTEG. REGIONS LOOK GOOD, WHICH ARE SAVED IN THAT OUTPUT FOLDER IN ANALYSIS
* add something in Ch. 4 text and maybe "(bleached)" in caption too, that says that green bleach figure (e) was bleached with ~165 s of 548 nm at 3.5 mW, w~=1000 micron
* change fig:CrBroad to say 693 in legend
* re-make 5-26 with the right calculation, and triple check numions, and also double check counts level on one, double check that the right ones are made into open circles
* after fixing 5-26 to do Xe ave (would it be easy to do 2/3 and 1/3?), have it plot crazy BG ones as open circles, and have text explaining (maybe not in caption), saying those have a more varying surface BG which correlates with a movement of the image.
* you have to check 8-7 numbers vs. what you get in ions_in_laser_region.xlsx:  run its script w/o saving, and w/ labels, and compare to what's in thesis as well as ions_in_laser_region w/ additional 0.8
* IS THERE ANY MENTION OF THE 0.8 STUFF IN THE TEXT?  I found nothing on it in Ch. 3.
* and for instances of Blah blah blah.  [ref]  (which should be Blah blah blah [ref].)
? see comment on ice cube paper
* does reference to future scanning make sense now on its own?  anything about re-pumping?
* check citation orders and figures too
* thing on paper, which I'm pretty sure is about checking figure placement

















(old) AT END:
...read carefully for content correctness (including references to what's in figures), wordings and typos
...READ all non-Imaging chapters for number of atoms, or counts/atom, quoted (will need 0.8 corr)
...change back to gray from red (astig fits)?
...look for figures where whole page is taken up by more figures but more than one caption -- Bill commented in old comments that, in Moethod, he had a hard time finding Fig. 4.2 (called 1.2 there).
...and then check figure placement, etc.
...also check for break-ups of "Fig. []", and "EXO-200", ... anything else?
...make sure the 15umX15um ~pg.84 (paragraph begins with "To determine the total 619-..." in Imaging) and its nearby 3pixelX... aren't cut off by lines, since they aren't ~ed, but I like the way they look and am making an exception.

=============================================
- pg. 1, Bob:  [2] is not original, but it is a translation of the original, at least of the German copy (1934)
Italian (1933):    http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02959820          -and-          http://www.phys.uniroma1.it/DipWeb/museo/collezione%20Fermi/documento1.htm
German (1934): http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01351864

- isotopically OK word? (pg. 8)

- Bill's pg. 10:  I just changed to ~20 cm -- is that ok now?  the numbers come from the long paper

- also on pg. 10:  is my "on order of mm/s" ok?

- why you circle 6 mm in topoogy?

- comment on KamLAND's stronger limit OK?

- like placement of mass vs. mass plot?  and the sentence structure, where it comes in the same paragraph as the effective mas eq.?

- changed "normal hierarchy" to "NH" on pg. 17

- can i ignore Bob's "why" on SXe thickness measuement on probe (w/ fibers)? i think it opens more than I want to talk about there.

- ...and can i ignore his "dimensions" thing on the conceptual probe?  it's conceptual.  ...can i ignore some comments?

- and similarly, Bruce wonders why 3D3 is ignored after.  But maybe I should not have a line for it in the figure?

- changed sentence before franck condon ("an illustration...")

- like new Franck Condon picture?  want more vibes in excited state, or shallower one?

- not sure what Bill means by "reference company too?" on pg. 33

- Bob does not like "instantaneously exposed", and to compensate for that I put "relative to..." in paranthases on pg. 50... what do you think about that?

- Beginning of Method:  Bob says "[are these plots yours]?" ... do I need to specify somewhere?  Really all but the absorption curve are mine.

- Method:  Bob didn't like how things are said here for the first time (577 eg) w/o having really been introduced as they are in Ch. 5 (since this is really a reference for that chapter ... SHOULD THESE SECTIONS BE APPENDiCES?

- somewhat ignoring the fitting "why chosen" -- "what physical motivation" based on the discussion we had in the room

- I just took out "at 77 K" for the sapphire (app.B) to avoid confusion, is this OK?

- like red versions of astig fit plots?

- Bill:  do we want to talk about Sr identification by McCaffrey?  Do we need to ask them?  How should i reference him?

- like new Franck-Condon?

- using 2 photons/counts like everyone else ... should I use 2.14 or whatever?


~~~~ changed wordings (thus of particular interest):
- 1st paragraph of 1.1.1
- 1st parag of 1.2:  sentence on suppressed beta decay
- beginning of anti-correlation parag.
- "sinusoidal motion..." sentence and readout sentence on page 52
- changed 694 to 693 based on Temp. data mainly from Guguschev
- added "(heating and re-cooling)" on pg. 66 for Bob
- changed "Decay of fluorescence" to "loss of emission" for Bob in first sentence of Bleaching (pg. 70)
- slightly changed the model agreement sentence, ala Bill comment on pg. 74
- H2 concentration on pg. 78
- added "[compare to getter deps]" to end of Ch. 5 (pg. 80), since no, I do not believe I ever looked for the 532etc. with the getter
- lots of referencing in imaging sections now -- pg. 84 and 81
- statement on similar signal level between 8-7 and 5-26 on pg. 86
- stuff on fit params being arbitrary in 4.1 intro paragraph
- "i.e. is reduced during laser exposure" to explain bleaching here, on NEW page 60






----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* it really seems like, e.g., (b) in green fitting figure is NOT the right wavelength...
* I put what I believe to be the correct 0.25 factor in the table for counts/photoelectron, but need to measure difference between gain / ADC modes (at some point).  IF YOU COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT ONE, NEED TO UPDATE QE PLOT, AND ALSO THE QUOTED NUMBERS IN TEXT (see QE.txt in realtemp/)
* should 76(5)% be 76(6)% on alphaion thing?
w sideways Cr3+ old comments (Bill) about quoting a detection number of Cr (talk to Bill)
w Sr lines in Blue excit.?  Issue is described in the unfinished, commented-out section in TEX file
w possible comment on large % of atoms in 619, at end of section right before Bleaching of the 619-nm Peak section (see Bill comments)
w "need to think about" comment, on poor fits in blue excit. around 478 nm, in old Bill comments (sec. 4.1.2)
* "fix this later" in Theory
* get ref for wuantum dots in cocnnlusions (did sing. mol.)
* also on that page need to specify Raman wavelength stuff
w coll eff stuff in Ch 3 v3 corrections.pdf
* * Question of Bill on pg. 16 of Ch 3 v3 corrections.pdf
* check M. Danilov ref [5] in corrections Ch. 1 v.3 corrections.pnf
w may want the rate-change paragraph uncommented at end of matrix iso., but need to se Bill comments [can't find that in Bill comments]
w need franck condon ref (see bill comments) [can't find that in Bill comments]
w short-time comment by Bill in 5-level model leading to exp decay at beginning, and demonstration of this in ch.5?
* shallower S in Franck Condon (see comments)
* check all data which you produced quickly in the middle of the night -- OF SPECIAL CONCERN is the light blue bleach model curve, since it's sort of discrepant, and you did that pretty quick ... um, seems fine
* DO ANY CALCULATIONS, LIKE QE, DEPEND ON COLL. EFF., AND DO THOSE NEED TO BE RE-DONE WITH NEW ONE? ... don't think so
* overlapping 100 thing in train plot
* find where Bill wanted a x.xx for Eqn. ref (since hard to know where it is ... because you changed one yourself in QE section) ... SEARCH FOR ALL EQN. REFS AND MAYBE DO THIS
* check the actual numbers of lowest QE for each peak, for correct quoting in text
* FIX (probably) text about QE -- prolly quotes numbers whic are now different, and maybe wanna say it uses correct sigmas
* w12 in QE -- I think it needs specific for each excitation wavelength
pw want a statement of "becomes bleached after x excitations"?  It reaches 1/e of (initial  "SS") in maybe 40,000 excit. in (b) and (c) of green/purple plots, but (a) is sort of different
* remove repeat deposits in bleaching data (including model), change comment on consistency then, and FIX COMMENTS ON POWERS, SINCE THEY ARE NO LONGER IN THE LEGEND ... LIKE, PUT THEM IN THE TEXT INSTEAD
* make color 2D gaus fits on astig fit fig.
* chanve m_betabeta to m_nu in the sensitivity plot, and make the axis labels like in talk
* make energy spectrum signature concept pic less dumb-looking

* plot time instead of Run Numb. in surf bleach plot
* change cross sections to cm^2
w change franck condon image ref to ...2.png
w semi-log on re-pump plots?  prolly
* check anti-corr plot:  is it actually like that in the real 2-nu?  otherwise idk what you should do. [it's in orig. 0nu]
* (sorta)check Xe bottle purity
* THETA 23 HAS WRONG DECIMAL PLACE IN TABLE
w sentence beginning w/ superscript 136 in Intro
w 1st parag of nu oscill. subsection: make it 2 sentences with perios before "that is, ..."
* check v-to-u spacing, as Bill circled 6mm in the topology figure   (it's from EXO instrum.)
* Bob wanting drift times of e-s and ions, pg. 10 (was there something about it being mentioned later, maybe with e- lifetime?)
* Bill comments on pg. 10 (EXP-200 voltages)
