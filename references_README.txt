An alternative Pauli letter citing, possibly, is from [K. Zuber, Phys. Rep. 305 (1998) 295], and is:

 W. Pauli, Fu¨ nf Arbeiten zum Ausschlie{ungsprinzip und zum Neutrino, Texte zur Forschung vol. 27, Wissenschaftliche
Buchgesellschaft Darmstadt 1977. W. Pauli, On the earlier and more recent history of the neutrino
(1957) in: K. Winter (Ed.), Neutrino Physics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991.






Also in that, he says:

The experimental discovery of the neutrino by Cowan and Reines [2] in 1956 and the
observation that there exist different types of neutrinos by Danby et al. [3] were important
milestones. The last important step about neutrinos stems from the LEP-experiments measuring
the Z0-width which results in 2.993$0.011 flavours for neutrino masses below 45 GeV [4]





from MOE:
Single-isolated Ba+ ions have been successfully detect
ed by their laser Auorescence in the classic experiment of
Neuhauser and co-workers [19].

MOE talks about Ba++ -> Ba+ via Xe conduction band (pg 44)
