BEFORE PRINTING, remove at least that one red thing in excitspec legend to write in w/ blue pen
- results:
  w two gray refs for Be:Xe and diffusion at x K
  w talk to Bill about sine fit to x (or rotated?) vibes (1.56 Adam got by hand on 50-ms ... you too?)
  - make less important plots side-by-side
  - better-looking train plot -- somehow w/ a bunch more images? w/ atoms ranges noted?
  - scanned images sec.
  - plots for blue excit.
  w bleaching green excitspec
  * fixed 619 bleach plot
  - talk to Bill about discrepancies between this and BaSpec -- leak rate and 11 K vs. 10 K


- do yourself the surface bg excitspec
- do yourself 2D dust spot stuff, cuz chris had less noisy results on his first try, andthe new one sucks
- thicker borders on small plots? test with excit spec to match the big one in that same figure.
- ba tagging in intro should have reference to Thomas gas tagging (does it?)
- if you're not refering to ba spec paper in intro, need to move the reference (did you?)
