- atomic physics, spec. notation, selection rules
- why do pot. energy curves have the shape they do when atoms are near (attractive vs. repulsive regions?)?
  and is it the system or the atom, cuz the fact that at infinity they approach the vacuum levels suggests that it's the atom

heh:
- Jahn Teller (orbital splitting -- see https://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/general/quantum_numbers/Quantum_Numbers.htm), and are there other explanations for the triplet structure?
- Heavy Atom Effect

- re-read anticorrelation

w joule thompson vs other normal one (cryogenic He gas?)
w why does He heat at some parameters?

- just go over atomic states stuff ... one question is: the 2 superscript means doublet (right?), so why is the ion ground state a doublet?  

- on sensitivity plot:
"To make this plot we used the best fit values of the mixing
	angles $\theta$sol=33.9°, $\theta$atm=45°, and $\theta$13=0° and the $\Delta$m2s
	(Table I)" from review bb Rev...pdf (2008)

- Majorana phases -- there's a section on them in one of those papers
