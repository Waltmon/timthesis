I thank my adviser William M. Fairbank, Jr. with inadequate words for his inspiring courage, foresight, and intuition as a physicist.  The success of this thesis, those to come, and of the experimental method which they work toward belongs foremost to him.  Special thanks also to Chris Chambers for tireless help with experiment and analysis, and ambition to continue the work.  I thank him and Adam Craycraft for companionship and intellectual input.  I thank Shon Cook and Brian Mong for developing the apparatus, pioneering the work, and training me along with Cesar Benitez and Kendy Hall.  I also thank the nEXO collaboration for their support, and especially their spokesman Giorgio Gratta.
